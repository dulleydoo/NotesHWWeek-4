    /*
    Variables
    -Variables must have a type - int,String, double, boolean, char, etc.
    -Variable must have a name
    -you cannot use a large value (double, float) in a small one (int)
    -You can put a large value in a small one.
    -declaration, creation, assignment
    -Dog myDog = new dog();
    -Declaring an array int[] nums
    -Each position of the array is automatically assigned a number in order from 0

    How Objects Behave
    -A method is what a class does. (behavior)
    -You can send things to a method such as arguments
    -You can get things back from a method

    Encapsulation
    -Encapsulation is keeping data hidden from other users by making them private.
    -When a variable is public, it can be accessed and changed through the variable itself.
    Encapsulating it and making it private will force the user to call its setter and getter
    in order to access it.

    The difference between instance and local variables
    -Instance variables are declared inside a class but not within a method
    -Local variables are declared within a method
    -Local variables must be declared before use

    Comparing reference and primitive variables
    -use == to compare to primitive variables
    -use .equals() method to see if two different objects are equal


    Serious Polymorphism
    -Animal is a class with animal features. lion extends animal but has more in depth feature/variables
    -an abstract class cannot be instantiated
    -when a class/subclass reaches a point where it is no longer abstract, it becomes concrete
    -an abstract method means it must be extended


    Life and Death of an Object
    -The stack - where methods invocations and local variables live
    -The heap - WHere all objects live
    -Methods are stacked
    -An object is created when a reference variable is declared, it
    gets created and assigned.
    -It can be constructed and created into the object.
    -Overloaded constructed means you have more than one constructor in your class
    -To compile each constructor must have a different argument list.
